# Algorithms and Data Structures Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for various algorithms and data structures, implemented in JavaScript/Node.js. Each algorithm and data structure is documented in a separate Markdown file, organized in descending order of popularity (with `00_` being the most popular).

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with a two-digit prefix followed by the name of the algorithm or data structure. For example:

*   `00_Arrays.md`
*   `01_Linked_Lists.md`
*   `00_Sorting_Algorithms.md`
*   `01_Searching_Algorithms.md`

## Content of Each File

Each Markdown file provides the following sections for the respective algorithm or data structure:

1.  **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the algorithm/data structure is, its purpose, and key characteristics.
2.  **Mentality Before Solving**: Guidance on when and why to use this particular algorithm/data structure, including considerations for problem-solving.
3.  **Code in JavaScript/Node.js**: A clear and well-commented implementation of the algorithm/data structure in JavaScript, suitable for Node.js environments. Includes example usage.
4.  **Edge Cases and How to Solve Them**: Discussion of common edge cases, potential pitfalls, and strategies to handle them robustly.
5.  **References**: A list of credible sources for further reading and deeper understanding.
